# WTF Solidity Tutorial: 12. Events

Recently, I have been revisiting Solidity, consolidating the finer details, and writing "WTF Solidity" tutorials for newbies.

In this section, we introduce `event` in `solidity` using transferring ERC20 tokens as an example .

## Events
The event in `solidity` are the transaction logs stored on the `EVM` (Ethereum Virtual Machine). They can be emited during function calls and are accessible with the contract address. Events have two characteristics：

- Responsive: Applications (e.g. [`ether.js`](https://learnblockchain.cn/docs/ethers.js/api-contract.html#id18)) can subscribe and listen to these events through `RPC` interface and respond at frontend.
- Economical: It is cheap to store data with events, costing about 2,000 `gas` each; By comparison, it takes at least 20,000 `gas` to store a new variable on-chain.

### Declare events
The events are declared with the `event` keyword, followed by event name, then the type and name of each parameter to be recorded. Let's take the `Transfer` event from the `ERC20` token contract as an example：
```solidity
event Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 value);
```
`Transfer` event records three parameters: `from`，`to`, and `value`，which correspond to the address where the tokens are sent, the receiving address, and the number of tokens being transferred. Parameter `from` and `to` are marked with `indexed` keywords, which will be stored at a special data structure known as `topics` and easily queried by programs.


### Emit events

We can emit events in functions. In the following example, each time the `_transfer()` function is called, `Transfer` events will be emitted and corresponding parameters will be recorded.
```solidity
    // define _transfer function，execute transfer logic
    function _transfer(
        address from,
        address to,
        uint256 amount
    ) external {

        _balances[from] = 10000000; // give some initial tokens to transfer address

        _balances[from] -=  amount; // "from" address minus the number of transfer
        _balances[to] += amount; // "to" address adds the number of transfer

        // emit event
        emit Transfer(from, to, amount);
    }
```

## EVM Log

EVM uses "Log" to store Solidity events. Each log contains two parts: `topics` and `log`.

### `Topics`

`Topics` is used to decribe events. Each event contains a maximum of 4 `topics`. Typically, the first `topic` is the event hash: the hash of the event signature. The event hash of `Transfer` event is calculated as follows:

```solidity
keccak256("Transfer(addrses,address,uint256)")

//0xddf252ad1be2c89b69c2b068fc378daa952ba7f163c4a11628f55a4df523b3ef
```

Besides event hash, `topics` can include 3 `indexed` parameters, such as the `from` and `to` parameters in `Transfer` event. The anonymous event is special: it does not have a event name and can have 4 `indexed` parameters at maximum.

`indexed` parameters can be understood as the indexed "key" for events, which can be easily queried by programs. The size of each `indexed` parameter is 32 bytes. For the parameter is larger than 32 bytes, such as `array` and `string`, the hash of the underlying data is stored.

### `Data`

Non-indexed parameters will be stored in the `data` section of the log. They can be interpreted as "value" of the event and can't be retrieved directly. But they can store data with larger size. Therefore, `data` section can be used to store complex data structures, such as arrays and strings. Moreovrer, `data` consumes less gas on storage compared to `topic`.

## Remix Demo
Let's take `Event.sol` contract as an example.

1. Deploy the `Event` contract.

2. Call `_transfer` function to emit `Transfer` event.

3. Check transaction details to check the emitted event.

### Query event on etherscan

Etherscan is a block explorer that lets you view public data on transactions, smart contracts, and more on the Ethereum blockchain. First, I deployed the contract to an ethereum testnet (Rinkeby or Goerli). Second, I called the `_transfer` function to transfer 100 tokens. After that, you can check the transaction details on `etherscan`：[URL](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/tx/0x8cf87215b23055896d93004112bbd8ab754f081b4491cb48c37592ca8f8a36c7)

Click `Logs` button to check the details of the event：

There are 3 elements in `Topics`: `[0]` is hash of the event, `[1]` and `[2]` are the `indexed` parameters defined in `Transfer` event (`from` and `to`). The element in `Data` is the non-indexed parameter `amount`.

## Summary
In this lecture, we introduced how to use and query events in `solidity`. Many on-chain analysis tools are based on solidity events, such as `Dune Analytics`.
