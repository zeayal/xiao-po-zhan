# WTF Solidity Tutorial: 22. Call

Recently, I have been revisiting Solidity, consolidating the finer details, and writing "WTF Solidity" tutorials for newbies.

Previously in [20: Sending ETH](https://github.com/AmazingAng/WTF-Solidity/tree/main/Languages/en/20_SendETH_en) we talked about sending `ETH` with `call`, in this tutorial we will dive into that. 

## Call
`call` is one of the `address` low-level functions which is used to interact with other contract. It returns the success condition and the returned data: `(bool, data)`. 

- Officially recommended by `solidity`, `call` is used to send `ETH` by triggering `fallback` or `receive` functions.
- `call` is not recommended for interacting with other contract, because you give away the control when calling a malicious contract. The recommended way is to create a contract reference and call its functions. See [21: Interact with other Contract](https://github.com/AmazingAng/WTF-Solidity/tree/main/Languages/en/21_CallContract_en)
- If the source code or `ABI` is not available, we cannot create contract variable; However we can still interact with other contract using `call` function.  

### Rules of using `call`
Rules of using `call`:
```
targetContractAddress.call(binary code);
```
the `binary code` is generated by `abi.encodeWithSignature`:
```
abi.encodeWithSignature("function signature", parameters separated by comma)
```
`function signature` is `"functionName(parameters separated by comma)"`. For example, `abi.encodeWithSignature("f(uint256,address)", _x, _addr)`。

In addition, we can specify the value of `ETH` and `gas` for the transaction when using `call`:

```
contractAdress.call{value:ETH value, gas:gas limit}(binary code);
```

It looks a bit complicated, lets see how to use `call` in examples.

### Target contract
Lets write and deploy a simple target contract `OtherContract`, the code is mostly same as chapter 19, only with an extra `fallback` function。

```solidity
contract OtherContract {
    uint256 private _x = 0; // state variable x
    // Receiving ETH event, log the amount and gas
    event Log(uint amount, uint gas);

    fallback() external payable{}

    // get the balance of the contract
    function getBalance() view public returns(uint) {
        return address(this).balance;
    }

    // set the value of _x, as well as receiving ETH (payable)
    function setX(uint256 x) external payable{
        _x = x;
        // emit Log event when receiving ETH
        if(msg.value > 0){
            emit Log(msg.value, gasleft());
        }
    }

    // read the value of x
    function getX() external view returns(uint x){
        x = _x;
    }
}
```

This contract includes a state variable `x`, a `Log` event for receiving `ETH`, and three functions:
- `getBalance()`: get the balance of contract
- `setX()`: `external payable` function, can be used to set the value of `x` and receiving `ETH`. 
- `getX()`: get the value of `x`.

### Contract interaction using `call`
**1. Response Event**

Lets write a `Call` contract to interact with the target functions in `OtherContract`. First we declare the `Response` event, which takes `success` and `data` returned from `call` as parameters. So we can check the return values.


```solidity
// Declare Response event, with parameters success and data
event Response(bool success, bytes data);
```

**2. Call setX function**

Now we declare the `callSetX` function to call the target function `setX()` in `OtherContract`. Meanwhile we send `msg.value` of `ETH`, then emit the `Response` event, with `success` and `data` as parameter:

```solidity
function callSetX(address payable _addr, uint256 x) public payable {
	// call setX()，and send ETH
	(bool success, bytes memory data) = _addr.call{value: msg.value}(
		abi.encodeWithSignature("setX(uint256)", x)
	);

	emit Response(success, data); //emit event
}
```

Now we call `callSetX` to change state variable `_x` to 5, pass the `OtherContract` address and `5` as parameters, since `setX()` does not have return value, so `data` is `0x` (i.e. Null)  in `Response` event.

**3. Call getX function**

Next we call `getX()` function, it will return the value of `_x` in `OtherContract`, the type is `uint256`. We can decode the return value from `call` function, and get its value. 


```solidity
function callGetX(address _addr) external returns(uint256){
	// call getX()
	(bool success, bytes memory data) = _addr.call(
		abi.encodeWithSignature("getX()")
	);

	emit Response(success, data); //emit event 
	return abi.decode(data, (uint256));
}
```
From the log of `Response` event, we see `data` is `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000005`. After decoding with `abi.decode`, the final return value is `5`.

**4. Call undeclared function**

If we try to call functions that are not present in `OtherContract` with `call`, the `fallback` function will be executed. 

```solidity
function callNonExist(address _addr) external{
	// call getX()
	(bool success, bytes memory data) = _addr.call(
		abi.encodeWithSignature("foo(uint256)")
	);

	emit Response(success, data); //emit event
}
```

In this example, we try to call `foo` which is not declared with `call`, the transaction will still succeed and return `success`, but the actual function executed was the `fallback` function.

## Summary

In this tutorial, we talked about how to interact with other contract using low-level function `call`. For security reasons, `call` is not recommended method, but it's useful when we don't know the source code and `ABI` of the target contract.
